     <P><b>Re: Eileen Dover university application</b></p>
     
     <p>Dear Eileen,</p>
     
     <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the university of Awesome's science faculty to study as part<br> of your PHD next year. I will answer your question one by one, in the following sections.</p>
     
     <p><b>Starting dates</b></p>
     
     <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it it will suit us if you<br> could start at the beginning of a semester; the start date for each one are as follows:</p>
     
     <ul>
      <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
      <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
      <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
     </ul>
     
     <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>
     
     <p>You can find more information about important university date on your website.</p>
     
     <p><b>Subjects of study</b></p>
     
     <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research faculty-as long as the subject fall<br> somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just<br> the kind of person would like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued<br> by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>
     
     <ul>
      <ol>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</ol>
      <ol>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 3<sup>0</sup>c (86F). when the<br> audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3x10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3x10<sup>4</sup>.)</ol>
      <ol>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</ol>
     </ul>
     
    <p>So please can you provide more information on each of this subject, including how long you'd expect the<br> research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>
    
    <p><b>Exotic dance moves</b></p>
    
    <p>Yes, you are right, As part of my post-doctorate work, I <i>did</i> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question,<br> my favourite dance are as follows, with definitions:</p>
    
    <p>Polynesian chicken dance</p>
    <p>A little know but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around<br> in a circle chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</p>
    <p>Icelandic brownian shuffle</p>
    <p>Before the icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which<br> involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in impereptibly<br> tiny, very rapid movement.One of my fellow student use to say that he thought this dance inspired<br> modern style such as twerking.</p>
    
    <p>Artic robot dance</p>
    <p>An interesting example of historical misinformation, English exploresr in the 1960s believed to have<br> discovered a new dance style characterist by "robotic", stilted movement, being practiced by inhabitants<br> of northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this<br> because they were really cold.</p>
